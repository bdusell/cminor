Usage: cminor [-h] [-t] [-s] [-l] [-o <output>] [<input.{cm,cminor}>]
    <input>      Specifies the input file. If omitted or given as "-", the
                 input is stdin.
    -o <output>  Specifies the output file. Upon error no output file is
                 created. If omitted, the output file has the name of the input
                 file with its suffix replaced. If omitted and the input is
                 stdin, or if the output file is given as "-", the output is
                 stdout.
    -t           Abstract syntax tree mode. Instead of compiling the program,
                 generates dot code representing the abstract syntax tree of
                 the input program.
    -s           Symbol resolution mode. Generates dot code representing the
                 abstract syntax tree of the input program, including nodes for
                 resolved symbols.
    -l           Only validates the input program for semantic correctness;
                 does not generate any code.
    -h           Prints this help message.
